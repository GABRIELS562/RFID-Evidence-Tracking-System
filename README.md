# RFID Evidence Tracking System - Portfolio Showcase

A modern, real-time RFID-based evidence tracking system designed for forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies. This showcase demonstrates advanced full-stack development capabilities with real-time tracking, 3D visualization, and comprehensive chain-of-custody management.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Forensic laboratories handle thousands of evidence items daily. Manual tracking methods lead to:
- Lost or misplaced evidence
- Broken chain of custody
- Delayed case processing
- Compliance violations
- Inefficient resource utilization

## ✨ Solution Features

- **Real-time RFID Tracking**: Live location updates for all evidence items with movement history
- **3D Laboratory Visualization**: Interactive 3D model of the forensic laboratory with real-time tracking
- **Chain of Custody Management**: Automated documentation with digital signatures and timestamps
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Predictive analytics, performance metrics, and custom reporting
- **Multi-Zone Management**: DNA Processing, Evidence Storage, Analysis Labs, Reception Areas
- **Court-Ready Reporting**: Generate legally admissible evidence packages and documentation
- **Multi-Language Support**: English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, and Sotho
- **Mobile Field Operations**: Support for mobile RFID scanners with offline capability
